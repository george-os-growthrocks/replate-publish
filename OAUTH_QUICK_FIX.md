# 🔐 OAUTH QUICK FIX

## ✅ **BOTH ISSUES FIXED!**

### Issue 1: Not Redirecting to Dashboard ❌
**Fix:** ✅ Enhanced auth state handling in `Auth.tsx`

### Issue 2: Redirecting to localhost in Production ❌
**Fix:** ✅ Using `VITE_SITE_URL` environment variable

---

## 🚀 **WHAT TO DO NOW:**

### Step 1: Set Environment Variable in Netlify

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard → Site settings → Environment**

Add:
```bash
VITE_SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
```

### Step 2: Update Supabase Redirect URLs

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration**

Add to **Redirect URLs**:
```
http://localhost:8080/auth
https://your-production-domain.com/auth
https://your-netlify-subdomain.netlify.app/auth
```

### Step 3: Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔐 Fix OAuth redirects"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🧪 **TEST:**

### Locally:
```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:8080/auth
# Sign in with Google
# Should auto-redirect to /dashboard ✅
```

### Production:
```
# Visit https://your-domain.com/auth
# Sign in with Google
# Should redirect to https://your-domain.com/dashboard ✅
# (NOT localhost!) ✅
```

---

## 🔍 **WHAT CHANGED:**

### In `Auth.tsx`:

1. **Enhanced session detection:**
   ```typescript
   // Now handles INITIAL_SESSION and TOKEN_REFRESHED events
   if (event === "TOKEN_REFRESHED" || event === "INITIAL_SESSION") {
     if (session) {
       navigate("/dashboard", { replace: true });
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Production-aware redirect:**
   ```typescript
   const redirectUrl = import.meta.env.PROD 
     ? (import.meta.env.VITE_SITE_URL || window.location.origin)
     : window.location.origin;
   ```

3. **Added debug logging:**
   - See what's happening in browser console
   - Easier to troubleshoot

---

## 📝 **ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:**

### Required in Netlify:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_SITE_URL=https://your-production-domain.com  ← NEW!
```
