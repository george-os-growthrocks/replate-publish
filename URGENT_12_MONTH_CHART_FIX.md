# üö® URGENT: 12-Month Chart & AI Overview Not Working

## What the User Reports
1. ‚ùå 12-month trend chart is NOT showing (but WAS working hours ago!)
2. ‚ùå AI Overview results are NOT showing

## Quick Diagnosis Steps

### Step 1: Open `test-keyword-bundle.html` in Browser
```bash
# Just open test-keyword-bundle.html in your browser
# Enter a keyword and click "Test Function"
# This will show if keyword-overview-bundle is returning data
```

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Open Keyword Research page: http://localhost:8080/keyword-research
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to Console tab
4. Search for a keyword
5. Click on any keyword result
6. Check console for:
   - `üìä Loading monthly trend data for: "keyword"`
   - `‚úÖ Loaded X months of trend data` OR
   - `‚ö†Ô∏è No monthly search data returned from DataForSEO`

### Step 3: Check If Function is Actually Deployed
```bash
# Check Supabase dashboard logs
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/siwzszmukfbzicjjkxro/functions/keyword-overview-bundle/logs
```

## Most Likely Issues

### Issue 1: DataForSEO historical_search_volume Returns Empty
- Labs historical API doesn't have data for all keywords
- Google Ads fallback should kick in but might not be working
- Check logs for: `üìä No Labs historical data, trying Google Ads volume as fallback...`

### Issue 2: Function Was Updated But Not Deployed Correctly
- We added Google Ads fallback but it might have broken something
- The function might be returning an error
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Issue 3: Frontend Auto-Load Not Working
- The `useEffect` at line 192-203 should auto-load trend data
- Check if it's being triggered
- Check if `monthlyTrendData` state is being set

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Revert to Simple Version (No Fallback)
Use the simple `dataforseo-labs-historical-search-volume` function directly

### Option 2: Debug the Current Function
Add more console.log to see exactly what's being returned

### Option 3: Use Keyword Overview `monthly_searches` Directly
The `keyword_overview` endpoint DOES return `monthly_searches` in the response

## For AI Overview

The AI Overview is NOT being displayed because:
1. We added `enable_ai_overview` flag to `dataforseo-serp` function
2. But we're NOT fetching SERP data in the Keyword Research page dialog
3. We're NOT displaying the AI Overview component

**Need to:**
1. Fetch SERP data when keyword is selected
2. Extract AI Overview from SERP response
3. Display using the `AIOverview` component from `src/components/serp/AIOverview.tsx`
