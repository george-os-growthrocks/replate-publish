## 💡 LEARNINGS & NOTES

1. **Supabase Migration Sync**: Using SQL Editor is faster than CLI migrations
2. **Component Reusability**: Empty states & skeletons save tons of dev time
3. **TypeScript Strictness**: Worth the upfront effort - caught many bugs
4. **Mobile-First**: Should design mobile layouts first, desktop is easier
5. **Credit System**: Users need constant visibility of credit balance

---

## 🤝 TEAM COLLABORATION

If working with others:
- All SQL changes documented in CRITICAL_RLS_POLICIES.sql
- Component patterns established for consistency
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- ESLint rules applied (mostly)

---

## 📞 SUPPORT & QUESTIONS

**Stuck on:**
- Nothing currently!

**Questions for review:**
- Should credit counter show on every page or just dashboard?
- Mobile sidebar: swipe-to-open or button-only?
- Empty states: should they be playful or professional?
