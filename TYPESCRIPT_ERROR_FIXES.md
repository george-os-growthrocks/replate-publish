# TypeScript Error Fixes Complete

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Error
**Problem**: `Module '"@/integrations/supabase/types"' has no exported member 'SubscriptionPlan'`

**Solution**: Changed import to use the correct Database interface:
```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
import { SubscriptionPlan as DBSubscriptionPlan } from "@/integrations/supabase/types";

// After (correct)
import { Database } from "@/integrations/supabase/types";
type SubscriptionPlan = Database['public']['Tables']['subscription_plans']['Row'];
```

### 2. React Query Cache Property Error
**Problem**: `'cacheTime' does not exist in type 'UseQueryOptions'`

**Solution**: Updated to use the newer React Query v5 property:
```typescript
// Before (deprecated in React Query v5)
cacheTime: 0

// After (React Query v5)
gcTime: 0 // "garbage collection time"
```

### 3. Type Assertion Issues
**Problem**: Issues with array length and map properties

**Solution**: The issues were resolved by fixing the import and ensuring proper typing throughout the component.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### React Query v5 Migration Notes
- `cacheTime` â†’ `gcTime` (garbage collection time)
- Same functionality, just renamed for clarity
- Still prevents caching of stale pricing data

### Database Type Safety
- Using proper Database interface from Supabase types
- Ensures all plan properties are correctly typed
- Maintains type safety throughout the component

## âœ… Result

- **Zero TypeScript errors**: All compilation issues resolved
- **Modern React Query**: Using latest v5 syntax
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support maintained
- **Cache Busting**: Still prevents stale data with `gcTime: 0`

The pricing components now compile cleanly with proper TypeScript support and modern React Query usage.
