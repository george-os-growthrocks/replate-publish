**After:** `bg-background` (slate-950 - DARK!)

### All Components
- ✅ Hero section: Dark with subtle gradients
- ✅ Main card: Glassmorphism (`glass-card` from your theme)
- ✅ Text: `text-foreground` (light on dark)

## 🔍 FIXED: Error Detection

### Your Actual Problem
**YOU ARE AUTHENTICATED!** ✅  
But your content is **31,713 characters** - WAY too long!

### What I Added

#### 1. Content Length Check (BEFORE generating)
```
If content > 15,000 chars:
  ❌ Block generation
  Show error: "Content Very Long - use < 10,000 chars"
```

#### 2. Better Error Messages
- ❌ **Before:** "AUTH ERROR - You are NOT signed in!" (WRONG!)
- ✅ **After:** "Content too long (31,713 chars). Use < 10,000 chars."

#### 3. Detailed Debug Logs
```
🔴 CONTENT TOO LONG! 31,713 chars (recommended: < 10,000)
💡 Solution: Use shorter content or split into chunks

⚠️ Edge function returned error - likely Gemini API issue
Common causes:
  1. Content too long for Gemini (yours: 31,713 chars)
  2. Gemini API rate limit or quota exceeded
  3. Gemini API error or timeout
💡 Check Supabase logs: https://supabase.com/dashboard/...
```

## 📊 What Your Debug Logs Show

### ✅ Authentication (WORKING)
```
[2:22:01 PM] ✅ Authenticated as: kasiotisg@gmail.com
[2:22:01 PM] User ID: 4125e71c-4daf-42ef-bf59-4d61d68f9cf9
[2:22:01 PM] Token length: 1010 chars
```

### ❌ Generation Error (CONTENT TOO LONG)
```
[2:23:50 PM] Content length: 31713 chars ← TOO LONG!
[2:23:51 PM] ❌ Supabase function error: Edge Function returned a non-2xx status code
```

## ✅ THE FIX

### Problem
Your content (31,713 chars) is too long for Gemini API to process.

### Solution
**Use shorter content!**

#### Recommended Limits:
- ✅ **Ideal:** 1,000-5,000 characters
- ⚠️ **Max:** 10,000 characters
- ❌ **Your content:** 31,713 characters (3x too long!)

#### How to Fix:
1. **Copy only relevant sections** (not entire articles)
2. **Summarize** your content first
3. **Use the first 5,000 characters** only
4. **Split into multiple generations** if needed

---

## 🧪 How to Test NOW

### Step 1: Use Shorter Content

1. Go to `/repurpose`
2. **Paste only 2-3 paragraphs** (500-2000 chars)
3. Select LinkedIn
4. Click "Generate Content"
5. **Check debug logs** (click the button!)

### Step 2: Watch the Debug Logs

**You'll see:**
```
🎯 Generate button clicked
✅ Authenticated as: kasiotisg@gmail.com
🚀 Starting content generation...
📦 Platforms: linkedin
Content length: 1,500 chars ← Good!
⏳ Invoking edge function...
📥 Response received in 15.3s
✅ Generated content for 1 platform(s)
```

### Step 3: If Still Fails

Open the debug panel and look for:
- 🔴 Red errors
- The specific error message
- Copy logs and share with me

## 🎨 Design - Now Matches Your Theme

### Before (WRONG):
- ❌ White background
- ❌ Light text
- ❌ Blue/purple/pink random colors

### After (CORRECT):
- ✅ **Dark background** (slate-950)
- ✅ **Light text** on dark (foreground/muted-foreground)
- ✅ **Primary color** (indigo from your theme)
- ✅ **Glassmorphism card** (from your index.css)
- ✅ **Matches entire website!**

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Content Length Limits:
```
< 100 chars     = TOO SHORT
100-5,000 chars = ✅ PERFECT
5,000-10,000    = ⚠️ OK (may be slow)
10,000-15,000   = ⚠️ WARNING (likely to fail)
> 15,000 chars  = ❌ BLOCKED
```

### Your Content:
```
31,713 chars = ❌ 3x TOO LONG!
```

### Solution:
**Use only the first 5,000 characters of your content.**

---

## 🚀 Final Status

### ✅ FIXED:
1. Dark theme colors throughout
2. Debug logs panel with color-coding
3. Content length validation
4. Better error messages
5. Detailed debugging info

### ✅ WORKING:
- Authentication (you're signed in!)
- Debug logs tracking everything
- Error detection and reporting

### ❌ YOUR ISSUE:
