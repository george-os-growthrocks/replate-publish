# Pricing Data Consistency Fixes

## ‚úÖ Issues Identified

### 1. Inconsistent Pricing Display
**Problem**: Showing different prices for same plan:
- Professional: $79/mo AND $99/mo
- Enterprise: $299/mo instead of planned price
- Duplicate features and conflicting data

### 2. Data Source Issues
**Potential Causes**:
- Database contains old/incorrect data
- React Query caching stale data
- Multiple entries with different values
- Hardcoded fallback values mixing with database data

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Reset Script
Created `FIX_INCONSISTENT_PRICING.sql` to:
- **Clear all existing data** to avoid conflicts
- **Insert clean, consistent data** with correct prices:
  - Free: $0
  - Starter: $29/mo ($290/yr)
  - Professional: $79/mo ($790/yr) 
  - Agency: $149/mo ($1490/yr)
  - Enterprise: $299/mo ($2990/yr)

### 2. React Query Cache Busting
Updated pricing component to:
- **Add timestamp to query key**: `['subscription_plans', Date.now()]`
- **Disable caching**: `staleTime: 0, cacheTime: 0`
- **Added debug logging**: Shows raw database data in console
- **Added refresh button**: Manual data refresh capability

### 3. Enhanced Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to see:
- Raw database response
- Filtered plan list
- Plan names and order

## üéØ Expected Results After SQL Script

### Correct Pricing Display:
```
Starter    - $29/mo  - 500 credits  - 3 projects   - 1 team
Professional- $79/mo  - 1,500 credits - 10 projects  - 5 team (Popular)
Agency     - $149/mo - 3,500 credits - 50 projects  - 20 team
Enterprise - $299/mo - 10,000 credits - 100 projects - 50 team
```

### Correct Feature Sets:
- **Starter**: Basic tools, email support
- **Professional**: Everything in Starter + GA4, analytics, priority support
- **Agency**: Everything in Professional + white-label, API access, team features
- **Enterprise**: Everything in Agency + custom integration, SLA, training

## üöÄ Required Actions

### Step 1: Run SQL Script
Execute `FIX_INCONSISTENT_PRICING.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. This will delete all existing plan data
2. Insert clean, consistent pricing data
3. Verify the results with the SELECT query

### Step 2: Refresh Frontend
1. Visit `/pricing` page
2. Click "Refresh Pricing Data" button
3. Check browser console for debug logs
4. Verify all prices and features are correct

### Step 3: Verify Order
Check that plans appear in this order:
- Starter ‚Üí Professional (highlighted) ‚Üí Agency ‚Üí Enterprise

## üîç Debug Verification

After running the SQL script, you should see in browser console:
```
Raw data from DB: [all 5 plans with correct data]
Loaded 4 plans from database: Starter, Professional, Agency, Enterprise
```

If you still see wrong prices, the refresh button should force a fresh data fetch.

## üìã Final State

- **Consistent Pricing**: No more $79/$99 conflicts
- **Correct Features**: Each plan has appropriate feature set
- **Proper Order**: Plans sorted by database sort_order
- **Live Data**: No more hardcoded fallback values
- **Debug Ready**: Easy to troubleshoot if issues persist
