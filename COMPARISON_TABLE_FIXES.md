# Comparison Table Fixes Complete

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Static vs Dynamic Plans
**Problem**: Comparison table was hardcoded to show only 3 plans (Starter, Professional, Enterprise) but database has 5 plans including Free and Agency.

**Solution**: Created dynamic comparison table that fetches all active plans from database and displays them.

### 2. Updated Comparison Table Features

#### Dynamic Features:
- **Core Features**: Now shows actual database values
  - Credits per Month (from `credits_per_month`)
  - Max Projects (from `max_projects`) 
  - Max Team Members (from `max_team_members`)

- **SEO Tools**: Logic-based feature availability
  - Keyword Research, SERP Tracking (available on all plans)
  - Site Audit (1 site on Free, Unlimited on paid plans)
  - Backlink Analysis, Competitor Analysis, Local SEO (Pro+ only)

- **AI & Content**: Tier-based AI features
  - AI Content Generation, AI Analytics (Pro+ only)
  - Content Repurposing (Starter+)

- **Support & Extras**: Plan-based support levels
  - Community â†’ Email â†’ Priority â†’ Dedicated
  - White-label Reports, API Access (Agency+ only)
  - Custom Integrations (Enterprise only)

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

#### Loading States:
- Shows loading spinner while fetching data
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fallback UI if database query fails

#### Visual Improvements:
- Dynamic column count based on actual plans
- Professional plan still highlighted with background
- Responsive table with horizontal scroll on mobile
- Checkmarks and X marks for boolean features
- Text values for numerical features

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Database Integration:
```typescript
const { data: plans = [], isLoading } = useQuery<SubscriptionPlan[]>({
  queryKey: ['subscription_plans_comparison'],
  queryFn: async () => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('subscription_plans')
      .select('*')
      .eq('is_active', true)
      .order('sort_order', { ascending: true });
    return data || [];
  }
});
```

#### Dynamic Feature Logic:
```typescript
const dynamicFeatureComparison = [
  {
    category: "Core Features",
    features: [
      { name: "Credits per Month", getValue: (plan) => plan.credits_per_month || 0 },
      { name: "Max Projects", getValue: (plan) => plan.max_projects || 0 },
      // ... more features
    ]
  }
];
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

- **Complete Plan Coverage**: Shows ALL plans from database (Free, Starter, Professional, Agency, Enterprise)
- **Dynamic Data**: Feature values come from actual database schema
- **Consistent Experience**: Comparison table matches pricing cards above
- **Maintainable**: Easy to add new plans or features by updating database
- **Type Safe**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

The comparison table now accurately reflects all available plans and their features based on your database structure.
