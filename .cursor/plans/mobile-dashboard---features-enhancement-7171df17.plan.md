# Mobile Dashboard & Platform Enhancement Plan

## Phase 1: Mobile Dashboard Responsive Fixes (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1.1 Top Filter Bar Mobile Optimization

**Files:** `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/PropertySelector.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/DateRangePicker.tsx`

**Current Issues:**

- Property selector, date range picker, and device filter cramped on mobile (lines 348-383 in DashboardLayout)
- Filter bar doesn't stack or collapse on small screens
- PropertySelector component (lines 112-203) takes too much horizontal space

**Solutions:**

- Add responsive breakpoints to filter bar: stack vertically on mobile (`md:flex-row flex-col`)
- Make PropertySelector collapsible on mobile - show only icon button, expand on click
- Compress date range picker on mobile - use icon trigger instead of full display
- Move device selector to dropdown on mobile
- Add horizontal scroll container with snap points for filters on very small screens

### 1.2 Charts & Tables Mobile Responsiveness

**Files:** `src/components/dashboard/DashboardCharts.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/DashboardMetricsCards.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/MetricsOverview.tsx`, `src/components/dashboard/TimeSeriesChart.tsx`

**Current Issues:**

- Recharts ResponsiveContainer doesn't properly handle mobile widths
- Fixed height charts (h-80, height={320}) cause horizontal scrolling
- TabsList in DashboardCharts (line 128) with `grid-cols-3` doesn't adapt
- Metric cards grid (line 101 in DashboardMetricsCards) needs better mobile breakpoints
- Pie charts and area charts overflow on small screens

**Solutions:**

- Add `min-h-[300px] h-[40vh] max-h-[400px]` for adaptive chart heights
- Implement horizontal scroll with overflow-x-auto for tables
- Add touch-friendly chart interactions (larger tooltip hit areas)
- Stack tabs vertically on mobile instead of grid
- Reduce chart margins and padding on mobile
- Add "View Full Screen" button for charts on mobile
- Implement virtual scrolling for large data tables

### 1.3 Mobile Navigation Enhancements

**Files:** `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx`
