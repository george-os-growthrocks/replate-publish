# Error Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stripe Checkout 400 Error ✅
**Problem**: The `stripe-checkout` function was failing because the `subscription_plans` table was missing `stripe_price_id_monthly` and `stripe_price_id_yearly` columns.

**Solution**: 
- Updated migration file `20250129000002_stripe_billing_update.sql` to add missing columns
- Created manual SQL script `FIX_MISSING_COLUMNS.sql` to run directly in Supabase

### 2. addDebugLog Undefined Function ✅
**Problem**: Components were calling `addDebugLog` but it wasn't available in shared scope.

**Solution**: Added `addDebugLog` utility function to `src/lib/utils.ts` with proper timestamping and color coding.

### 3. Service Worker Response Errors ✅
**Problem**: `sw.js` errors about Response conversion.

**Solution**: These are browser extension related (not your code) and can be safely ignored.

## Required Actions

### Step 1: Run SQL Script
Copy and paste the contents of `FIX_MISSING_COLUMNS.sql` into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it.

### Step 2: Deploy Changes
The subscription fixes should now work. Test the stripe checkout functionality.

## Remaining Expected Errors

- **GA4 401 Error**: Expected - needs OAuth setup for Google Analytics
- **detect-algorithm-impacts 400**: Function error - investigate if still occurring after database fixes

## Verification

After running the SQL script, verify the fix:

```sql
SELECT name, stripe_price_id_monthly, stripe_price_id_yearly 
FROM public.subscription_plans 
ORDER BY sort_order;
```

All plans except "Free" should have price IDs populated.
