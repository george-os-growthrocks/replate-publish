## ⚡ QUICK START (15 Minutes)

### **Step 1: Add User Credits** (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)
4. Paste this script:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    user1_id UUID;
    user2_id UUID;
BEGIN
    SELECT id INTO user1_id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'kasiotisg@gmail.com';
    SELECT id INTO user2_id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'Fwtiskoukakis5@gmail.com';
    
    IF user1_id IS NOT NULL THEN
        INSERT INTO user_credits (user_id, total_credits, used_credits)
        VALUES (user1_id, 5000, 0)
        ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET 
            total_credits = user_credits.total_credits + 5000;
    END IF;
    
    IF user2_id IS NOT NULL THEN
        INSERT INTO user_credits (user_id, total_credits, used_credits)
        VALUES (user2_id, 2500, 0)
        ON CONFLICT (user_id) DO UPDATE SET 
            total_credits = user_credits.total_credits + 2500;
    END IF;
END $$;
```

5. Click **RUN** (or press F5)
6. Should see: "Success. No rows returned"

✅ **Result**: kasiotisg@gmail.com has 5,000 credits, Fwtiskoukakis5@gmail.com has 2,500 credits

### **Step 2: Add Google Analytics** (2 minutes)

1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com
2. Create a new GA4 property (if you haven't)
3. Copy your Measurement ID (looks like `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
4. In your project root, create `.env.local`:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env.local
```

5. Open `.env.local` and add:

```env
VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual ID

✅ **Result**: Google Analytics will track all user activity
